           <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Free will</strong> is the ability to choose without being forced by external factors. It is related to moral responsibility and human actions. Philosophers debate whether free will is compatible with determinism, which says that only one course of events is possible.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Free will</strong> is the capacity to act freely without being constrained by outside influences. It involves moral judgements and ethical decisions. There are different views on how free will relates to determinism, which claims that everything is predetermined by prior causes.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Moral absolutism</strong> is like a rule that says some things are always good or bad no matter what. It’s like when your parents tell you not to hit your brother or sister because it’s always bad to do that. It’s different from other rules that say whether something is good or bad depends on what happens after you do it. For example, if you take a toy from your brother or sister and they cry, then taking the toy was bad because it made them cry. But if you take the toy and they don’t care, then taking the toy wasn’t bad because it didn’t hurt anyone’s feelings.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Morals</strong> are like rules that tell us what is right and wrong. Some people think that these rules are always the same for everyone and never change. Other people think that these rules can be different for different people and can change over time. So, some people think that morals are objective, which means they are always the same for everyone and never change. Other people think that morals are subjective, which means they can be different for different people and can change over time.            </li>
